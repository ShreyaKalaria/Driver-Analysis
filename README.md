# Driver Analysis
 Analysis of kernel mode device drivers, in an attempt to find bugs or vulnerabilities. All exploits that have been patched by the vendor that are related to the device driver will be disclosed in this GitHub repository as well.

# How can I analyze these drivers myself?
You can analyze these drivers using the attached IDA Pro 7.5 database. Keep in mind, that to use one of the IDA Pro 7.5 databases, you *need* IDA Pro 7.5 (obvious enough?).
